To run the unit tests the following command can be used:

./test_netschedule.py 9102 --path-netschedule=/export/home/satskyse/ns_testsuite --db-path=/export/home/satskyse/ns_testsuite/data.9102 --ns-version=4.16.4 --path-grid-cli=/export/home/satskyse/ns_testsuite --start-from=0

where:
9102 is a port number on which the server accepts the requests
--path-netschedule specifies the directory where the server binary is
--db-path specifies the directory where the server strores its data
--ns-version specifies what version of the server is tested
--path-grid-cli specifies the directory where grid_cli utility is located
--start-from tells the test number from which the test suite should start

use --help for the full list of options


There is another quick test script:
./test_ns_commands.py localhost:9102
it may be useful running it together with valgrind
