/// Interface class (and self-factory) for request processor objects that can
/// retrieve data from a given data source.
/// The overal life cycle of the processors is as follows.
/// There is a one-time processors registration stage. On this stage a default
/// processor constructor will be used.
/// Then at the time when a request comes, all the registred processors will
/// receive the CreateProcessor(...) call. All not NULL processors will be
/// considered as those which are able to process the request.
/// Later the infrastructure will call the created processors Process() method
/// in parallel and periodically will call GetStatus() method. When all
/// processors finished it is considered as the end of the request processing.
///
/// There are a few agreements for the processors.
/// - The server replies use PSG protocol. When something is needed to be sent
///   to the client then m_Reply method should be used.
/// - When a processor is finished it should call the
///   SignalProcessorFinished() method.
/// - If a processor needs to do any logging then two thing need to be done:
///   - Set request context fot the current thread.
///   - Use one of the macro PSG_TRACE, PSG_INFO, PSG_WARNING, PSG_ERROR,
///     PSG_CRITICAL, PSG_MESSAGE (pubseq_gateway_logging.hpp)
///   - Reset request context
///   E.g.:
///   { CRequestContextResetter     context_resetter;
///     m_Request->SetRequestContext();
///     ...
///     PSG_WARNING("Something"); }
/// - The ProcessEvents() method can be called periodically (in addition to
///   some events like Cassandra data ready)
