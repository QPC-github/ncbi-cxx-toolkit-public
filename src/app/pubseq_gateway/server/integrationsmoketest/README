To run the integration tests someone may use the following command line:

./integration_test localhost:2180

The localhost:2180 needs to be replaced with the host port of the running PSG
server.

Note: the script uses psg_client. First, psg_client is searched in the directory
of the script. Otherwise the PATH available will be used.
