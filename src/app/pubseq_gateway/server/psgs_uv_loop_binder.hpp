// libuv offers two places for the callbacks:
// - prepare (before io)
// - check (after io)
// The define below switches between prepare and check callback
// Note: it is possible to add a feature of the runtime switch between these
// callbacks (an argument for the binding)
#define USE_PREPARE_CB 0


// The class provides ability to setup a callback which will be invoked from
// the libuv event loop.
// The design idea is that there is a protected queue of the callbacks which
// should be invoked from the libuv event loop. When the users postpone their
// callbacks it essentially leads to two actions:
// - memorize the callback in the protected queue
// - send the libuv async message to wakeup libuv if it is waiting on something
// Then there is as well a prepare callback setup for libuv once at the very
// beginning of the server lifetime. The prepare callback is invoked when libuv
// is woken up by an async message. The responsibility of the prepare callback
// is to check the callback queue and invoke the stored callbacks.
//
// The drawback is that the prepare callback is called once per libuv event
// loop. However it should not affect the performance severely.
//
// The async message cannot be used alone because there is no guarantee that
// its callback will be called exactly once per uv_async_send()
// See more info here:
